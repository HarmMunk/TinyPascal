This TinyPascal repository contains the source, example and test files of the Tiny Pascal compiler system, adapted for CP/M.

The original Tiny Pascal system was developed in 1978 by Herbert Yuan and Kin-Man Chung for the Intel 8080-based North Star microcomputer.
It was published in three articles in Byte magazine in September, October and December 1978.

I rewrote the system in 1982 for the casette-based Microsoft Basic 5 interpreter on an Exidy Sorcerer. In 2012-2014 I resurrected
that version on the SIMH altair Z80 simulator and added some CP/M extensions. Unfortunately, I lost the source files of that 2012 version,
so during the corona pandemic I scanned the listings and implemented (and debugged/corrected) the CP/M version anew.

The compiler in MBASIC is loosely based on the Yuan and Chung version in the sense that I kept some of the variable names. Other than that,
it is a complete rewrite of the compiler, including some language changes. The compiler (TPC.BAS) compiles Tiny Pascal source code to
pseudocode (or P-code).

Back in 1982 I rewrote both the translator (TRANS.BAS) and the run-time system. In 2012 I added minimal CP/M support by providing a
standard function BDOS that accesses the CP/M basic disk operating system.

I also added some test files, an implementation of the mastermind game, and a P-code dump program, based on the one Yen and Chung's article.
That last program can be used as the starting point for a P-code interpreter. It is a bit of work that I have not come round to.
